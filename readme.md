MongoDB
Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/fitness-tracker.git
Navigate to the project directory:

bash
Copy code
cd fitness-tracker
Install dependencies for both the frontend and backend:

bash
Copy code
# Navigate to the frontend directory
cd fitness-app
npm install  # Install frontend dependencies

# Navigate to the backend directory
cd ../fitness-tracker
npm install  # Install backend dependencies
Configuration
Create a .env file in the server directory to store environment variables, including MongoDB URI and JWT secret.

Example .env file:

makefile
Copy code
PORT=3000
MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key
Running the Application
Start the backend server:

bash
Copy code
cd fitness-tracker
npm start
Start the frontend:

bash
Copy code
cd fitness-app
npm run dev
This will launch the frontend on the default Vite server (usually http://localhost:5173) and the backend on http://localhost:3000 (or the port specified in the .env file).

Happy tracking!
